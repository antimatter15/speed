This is a sort of interesting name because
I thought of making this while catching a 
season of Breaking Bad, which is about a 
meth manufacturer, and another name of the
drug is speed. So ha. Also it adjusts vlc's
playback speed so I can more efficiently 
waste my time.

It's not very hard to use.

python speed.py < path_to_srt

Stealing from the videolan wiki:

#to set up vlc to use this script, go to tools->preferences and 
#click on "show settings->all" at the bottom. from that menu, 
#select "Interface->Main Interfaces", and check the "Remote Control 
#Interface" box. Next, select "Interface->Main Interfaces->RC",
#check the "Fake TTY' box, and enter 'home/YOURNAME/vlc.sock'in
#the "UNIX socket command input" field.
